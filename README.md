# Synchronize
Senior Capstone Project, Synchronize
This repository contains the collective effort of Alex Nguyen, Charlie Nguyen and
Ian Reyes in the creation of an application set to simplify and streamline 
Schedules and allow effortless coordination and collaboration between peers.
Synchronize allows user to link schedules between each other in order to see 
overlap or gaps in the schedule in order to better plan events. The application 
also aims to seemlessly integrate itself into most users live by allowing the user
to sync calender data from existing third party platforms such as Google and 
Microsoft and add them into the display page, i.e. work schedule on miscrosoft 
teams will display on the Synchronize calender view.

## How to Run Calendar
```
npm install
npm start
